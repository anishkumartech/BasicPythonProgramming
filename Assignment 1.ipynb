    "\n",
    "An expression is a combination of one or more values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions can be very simple, such as a single number or variable, or they can be more complex, involving multiple values and operators. For example, the expression \"1 + 2\" is a simple expression that evaluates to the value 3, while the expression \"(3 * 3) - (10 / 2)\" is a more complex expression that evaluates to the value 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "All expressions in programming serve the purpose of producing a value. This value can be used in other parts of the program, such as being assigned to a variable, used in a conditional statement, or passed as an argument to a function. Expressions can also be used to perform operations, such as mathematical calculations or string manipulations.\n",

    "\n",
    "An assignment statement, such as \"spam = 10\", is a specific type of statement that assigns a value (in this case, the integer 10) to a variable (in this case, \"spam\"). The act of assigning a value to a variable is itself an expression, but the overall instruction \"spam = 10\" is a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a statement is a complete unit of execution in a program, while an expression is a component of a statement that can be evaluated to produce a value. In most programming languages, expressions can be combined within statements to perform various tasks, such as assigning values to variables, performing calculations, or making decisions based on conditions.\n"

    "Variable names must start with a letter or underscore (_). They cannot start with a number.\n",
    "\n",
