    "\n",
    " The Boolean data type in Python represents logical values, and there are two possible values: True and False.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the True value is represented as the keyword True (without quotes and with an uppercase \"T\"), and the False value is represented as the keyword False (also without quotes and with an uppercase \"F\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean values are used to represent the truth or falsity of a condition in logical expressions and control statements in programming. For example, the expression 5 > 3 will evaluate to True because it is true that 5 is greater than 3, while the expression 5 < 3 will evaluate to False because it is false that 5 is less than 3.\n"
