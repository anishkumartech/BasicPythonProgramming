    "#### 2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "Raw strings are used in Regex objects because regular expressions often contain backslashes, which are also used in Python to escape characters. Using raw strings allows backslashes in regular expressions to be interpreted as literal backslashes, rather than as escape characters for special characters in the regular expression pattern. This makes it easier to write and read regular expressions that contain backslashes."
